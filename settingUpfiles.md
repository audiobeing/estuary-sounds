# setting up files to add to estuary 
- all audio files need to be .wav files - this is the format that works consistently with chrome which is the best for estuary
- all audio files need to be in a folder both of which are named with short names with no special characters or spaces, and do not start with numbers. Numbers after are fine. 
    - ex. `drums2`, `ddr45`, etc - names that describe are better for remembering but not necessary - short are best for working in estuary. 
- long files are fine but do need to be handled in estuary in particular ways which will become clear. Two approaches are to leave longer files as is and handle in estuary or to separate them into sections. As estuary works with patterns of samples there are more options for a collection of 1 sec files (in one folder) than a 15 sec file. That said, it is nice to have some long files. Minute(s) long start reaching the boundary of too long. Again playing with them is possible as we will see. 
- if you have a single file it needs to be in a folder
- if you have a collection of files it becomes a decision of how to organize them. 
- Having a collection of related files in a folder (segmented longer file, or related files such as pecussion, or simply sounds that work well together for whatever reason) have a wide variety of options in estuary and is the standard setup. It is rarer to only have one files as the list below shows for the default sounds.
- a collection of files in a single folder is known as a `bank`
- organizing files is an interesting task that is an open (for the better) issue
